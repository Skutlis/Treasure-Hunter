## Version 4.0
This is the fourth version of our 2D platformer game.
You now have multiple maps, and are greeted by both a  new starting screen and some mysterious background music. If you hover your mouse over the play button you would now see that is shows that you are on the button.
Player is now animated while walking/jumping and while standing still. The ghosts are also animated. At the top left-hand corner, you can now see the improved healthbar that changes gradually
while the health declines. Right under that you will see the points the player has. If you were to fall off the map, or die to an enemy you would be greeted by a new death screen.
This gives you the option to either play again or quit.
